# HTTP Requests Checker
This is a basic HTTP requests checker, which would allow a user to send HTTP requests (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to any standard HTTP server and get the appropriate responses in return. The user will be able to send URL parameters (in the case of GET and HEAD requests) and form data and files (in the case of POST and PUT requests) along with the HTTP requests. The HTTP requests checker application will fetch responses from servers and display the URL, the status code and the serverâ€™s response headers.

Please see the [report](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/http-requests-checker/blob/main/Browser%20(Project%20Final%20Report).pdf) of this project which has all the information and details required to run this application successfully.
